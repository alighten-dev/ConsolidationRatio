# ConsolidationRatio
NinjaTrader 8 Indicator that helps to identify if price is in consolidation. 

Consolidation Ratio takes the overall range of a period and divides it by the average range of each candle for that period. The result is an increasing Consolidation Ratio as price trends and a decreasing Consolidation Ratio as price consolidates.
